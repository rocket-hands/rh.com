LaggyDash is Kranzky's February entry to 1GAM. It's a massively single-player
infinite runner.

The idea is that you control a female ninja who is running over an undulating
landscape at sunset, dodging bombs and collecting coins. It's a typical
endurance game in the vein of Flappy Bird, complete with tweeting your best
score when you finally eat a bomb, and with acceptable playability on mobile
devices thanks to how much HTML5+JavaScript has improved over the last few
years.

The "massively single player" part of the equation comes into play when more
than one person is playing the game at the same time; everyone else playing
appears in the guise of a wolf, chasing your ninja.
