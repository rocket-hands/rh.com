Dive
====

I've wanted to make this game for a while. It's completely inspired by [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUcpzf0rbAw) of William Truebridge
breaking the unassised free diving depth record. I found it quite evocative
wanted to see if some of that feeling could be conveyed in a simple game.

CONTROLS
--------

Tap the lower half of the screen to swim one 'stroke' downwards. The top half
for upwards.

There is a bit of a knack to the controls, you need to hold for around about a
second, then release and quickly start the next stroke before you float up.

The aim is of course to reach a depth and turn around in time to get to the
surface before your oxygen runs out. If you fail to do so your score won't count.

The idea is that you want pace your strokes in the most efficient way possible,
as swimming too 'fast' won't get you any more distance but will make you use
oxygen faster.

ASSETS
------

The dude is a $15 purchase from the unity store. He's meant to be a medieval
warrior but he came with some swim animations and with some poking around he
fits the needs of the game quite well :)

TODO
----

I had some extra ideas to make the game more accurate, you'll see in the video
that William 'free-falls' after a certain depth. I haven't had time to tweak
things like depth affecting buouancy and the ability to exhale.

I might revisit it at some point.
