Refrax is a game for 1 to 4 players. The goal is simple: clear each level of the
orbs scattered about hither and thither by the evil Dr. Nasty, or live with the
destruction of the known universe on your conscience, with the evil Dr's cackle
ringing in your ears. To defuse an orb, simply guide one of the four light beams
into it. Achieve this by strategically deflecting a light beam in the right
direction. Each light beam is controlled separately, meaning that four players
can guide one each, one dextrous player can guide all four, or any other
possible combination of human beings and light beams that you can imagine.

Refrax was written by Jason Hutchens, with Philip Dunstan. It was inspired by
the mini-game to be found in the pause mode of Jeff Minter's Iridis Alpha, an
excellent game on the Commodore 64.
