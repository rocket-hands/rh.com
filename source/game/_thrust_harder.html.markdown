THRUST HARDER
=============

"Thrust Harder", by the Kranzky Brothers, published by Arsepipe Productions. The
Kranzky Brothers are Lloyd Kranzky (programmer), Keith Kranzky (graphics) and
Brian Kranzky (sound effects and music).

The game is a mashup of Thrust, Exile, Mercenary and so forth. You can run
around as a little spaceman, in which case you use keyboard to move and mouse to
aim and shoot. You can drive a land vehicle, or board a spacecraft to fly
around. A little economy based on ore, destructive objects, HP and XP all over
the shop, updrades and levelling, a drive to explore, a rescue mission to find
all colonists.
