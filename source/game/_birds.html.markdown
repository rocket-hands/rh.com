Birds is a flash metroidvania style explore and jump-em up.

You can play the 'demo' now in your browser: [Flash Version](/birds.html)

It's not anywhere near finished and the demo is just a compelling (IMO)
collection of cute animations and mechanics. A proof of concept.
When it came time to make some levels and storyline I kind of froze up.
I'm good at mechanics and 'nifty'. I'm not so good at substance and content.

If I revisit birds it will be from scratch (the codebase is dead, as is flash),
but I really want to one day. Maybe when I'm more prepared, breadth-of-skills-wise,
or find someone dead-set on helping me with the story and level design.
