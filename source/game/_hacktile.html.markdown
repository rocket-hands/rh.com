Hacktile is a "Cellular Automata Game Engine", and was one of two projects the
RocketHands crew were working on in 2011 / 2012. It began during our period of
intense jamming at the end of 2010, during which Kranzky prototyped "Professor
Lazybones and the Cellular Automata Game Engine", a video of which is below:

The idea was to encode a cellular automata in a special language that could
either be hosted somewhere (perhaps in HTML comments on a web page), or that
could be encoded directly in the URL, like this:

Play around with it, it's fun!
