99 Sheep
========

This is entry of Lloyd Kranzky entry for May "game jams". I am much better after
operation, and sorry I cannot be at "globe game jams" before. Also I work very
much of lately, very surprise in economic downturns, but every man needs a
plumb, and so the saying goes!

CONTROLS
--------

Captain Onion return in sequel! Please move raket with keys or even with
controller. The aim is to make friends of sheeps by "scorching" to reflect
colour and then collect the match ones. Simply!
